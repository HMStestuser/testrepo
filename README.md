# HMSBootCamp

## Setup

### Command Line Basics

The command line is a text-based means of interacting with your computer. For the purposes of this bootcamp, it will allow you to navigate your folders (i.e. file directories) and utilize a program called git for version control. The following are basic commands you can use to get around the command line.

- `ls` "lists" files and directories directly inside the current directory
- `cd [folder-name]` "change directory" to the given path (relative to the current working directory)
- `cd ..` move up 1 step to the parent directory from the current directory
- `pwd` "print working directory" displays the full file path to the current directory

### Installing Git

Git is a program used for version control. For the purposes of this bootcamp, you will use it to track changes you make to your files/code. See instructions below for your operating system.

- MacOS
  - You probably already have git installed! Move on for now and reference the following bullet if you see `git: command not found` when trying to use a git command
  - Open the **Terminal** app and type in `xcode-select -install` to install a suite of useful tools for programming, including git
- Windows
  - Install git from the official [link](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
